The only real important one for the sake of this project is Jitsi Meet. This is the main video conferencing application that has been extremely well-maintained and well-documented. It comes in a few forms via their docs, including downloading as a complete docker file that Just Works\u2122. However, you probably don't want that if, like me, you don't really understand Docker and its limitations.</p>"},{"location":"Introduction/jitsi-meet/#setup-advice","title":"Setup Advice","text":"<p>My advice: before even setting up a Jitsi server, have a purchased domain ready from a major provider like Cloudflare. Also, don't try to run peer-to-peer or locally. I managed to run my own Jitsi server from my own machine, but it requires access to your router so that you can enable port-forwarding ports. I probably spent two weekends trying to use a relay to access my server via STUN/TURN servers. Just skip all that, get AWS free tier, and install it on an EC2.</p> <p>Holy crap, the handbook actually has that exact advice. Too bad I didn't listen. But you can, and you should.</p>"},{"location":"Introduction/nice-dcv/","title":"NICE DCV","text":"<p>Amazon DCV (previously NICE DCV) is a remote desktop protocol (RDP). RDP lets you take remote control of someone else's computer, while having their screen streamed directly to you. The main app for doing this is literally just called Windows RDP. DCV costs nothing, it's like a package that unlocks extra functionality on EC2 instances.</p> <p>So why did Amazon acquire DCV for a bunch of money? Here are a few things that are special about DCV:</p> <ol> <li>Multi-user support: Several users can remote in at the same time, Windows RDP only allows one session</li> <li>Cross-platform: Supported on the three main operating systems (MacOS, Linux, Windows)</li> <li>High performance: DCV supports 4K and 60 FPS, and will compress the image quality in order to maintain low latency</li> <li>Dynamic resizing: DCV can resize the remote session based on the size of the end user's client</li> </ol> <p>All these things make DCV an interesting choice for companies that have expensive, highly customized workstations because they can simply remote into that machine. It also is good for gaming and is the remote desktop protocol that supports PLAICraft.</p>"},{"location":"Introduction/nice-dcv/#does-it-just-worktm","title":"Does it Just Work\u2122?","text":"<p>Like, almost. DCV itself is incredibly stable, but just be warned that if you don't have a valid SSL, you're SOL. Both Jitsi Meet and DCV use TCP/UDP for video streaming (rather than HTTP), and anything Websocket, WebRTC or UDP-based will basically reject a connection unless both sides have valid SSL certificates. SSL certificates are very easily generated from a domain provider like Cloudflare when you own a domain.</p> <p>Also, keep in mind that DCV is closed-source, and early on I tried to figure out how to separate inputs between multiple users in DCV, but I barely made a scratch.</p>"},{"location":"Introduction/open-world-agents/","title":"Open World Agents","text":"<p>PLAICraft, to capture multimodal training data, has a bespoke setup consisting of [[OBS]], a Minecraft mod package called Spigot, and then whatever middleware they used to pack it all in together.

It doesn't matter if the user interface is Minecraft, Excel or trading Memecoins; the inputs of screen, audio, mouse and keyboard ought to be the same.</p> <p>Actually, another win for DCV: it allows I/O devices, so bring your USB steering wheel.</p>"},{"location":"Introduction/open-world-agents/#ocap","title":"OCAP","text":"<p>The key component for this project from Open World Agents is called OCAP.

You can generally install from Gstreamer the same way that people install from a package manager like brew or pip. Open World Agents and OCAP use Anaconda, which as far as I know is a virtual environment and path manager, not unlike a python virtual environment.
