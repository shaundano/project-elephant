# Phase 1: Setting up EC2, DCV and OCAP

## Overview

The goal for this section is to use DCV to remote into your virtual machine running Windows, and have run OCAP successfully.

## What You'll Learn

This phase covers the complete setup process from creating your EC2 instance to running OCAP:

1. **[EC2](ec2.md)** - Launch and configure your Windows Server EC2 instance with security groups
2. **[DCV](dcv.md)** - Connect via RDP and install NICE DCV for remote desktop
3. **[OCAP](ocap.md)** - Install and configure OCAP for desktop capture
4. **[Fork Discussion](fork-discussion.md)** - Technical details about the custom OCAP fork

By the end of this phase, you should have:
