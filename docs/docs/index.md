# Welcome

My name is **Chris** and I created this project as part of my directed study under Dr. Frank Wood in the Fall of 2025.

## About This Documentation

My goal of this technical report is to attempt to capture the 3 months I spent building this project such that if you were to start from nothing, you could probably do everything that I have done in the span of a week. I want to acknowledge that I cut some corners for the sake of speed.

## Acknowledgments

I am indebted to everyone on the [PLAICraft project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12707), who paved a lot of the way for this project to happen. I worked on PLAICraft for about 6 months, and I would say that the best way to describe my project is that it's a **PLAICraft for anything**.

## What to Expect

I will try to keep these docs exciting by attempting to be funny. Sorry in advance. I am incredibly excited to dump the wealth of notes I have taken, and explain exactly how I overcame the various "gotchas" in building a scalable cloud framework for capturing training data for desktop agents.
